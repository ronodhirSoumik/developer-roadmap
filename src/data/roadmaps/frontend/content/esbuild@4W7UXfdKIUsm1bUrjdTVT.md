# esbuild

esbuild is a very fast JavaScript bundler and minifier. It's written in Go, so it's much quicker than older tools. esbuild handles modern JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX. It bundles code almost instantly, even for big projects. It's easy to use with a simple API. While super fast, it might not have all the advanced features of older bundlers, but it's great for development and as a base for other tools.
