# RAIL Model

The RAIL Model from Google helps make websites feel fast. RAIL stands for Response (quick reaction to clicks), Animation (smooth visuals), Idle (using downtime well), and Load (fast page start). It sets goals like responding in 100ms and animations at 60fps. Following RAIL makes users happier because the site feels responsive.
