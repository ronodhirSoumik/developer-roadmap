We have revised the C++ and Java roadmaps and introduced an AI tutor to help you learn anything.

- We just launched an [AI Tutor](https://roadmap.sh/ai), just give it a topic, pick a difficulty level and it will generate a personalized study plan for you. There is a map view, quizzes an embedded chat to help you along the way.
- [C++ roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/cpp) has been revised with improved content
- We have also redrawn the [Java roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/java) from scratch, replacing the deprecated items, adding new content and improving the overall structure.
