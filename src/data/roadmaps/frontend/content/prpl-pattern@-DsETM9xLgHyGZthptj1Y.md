# PRPL Pattern

The PRPL pattern helps websites load fast, especially on mobile. PRPL means: Push critical resources, Render the first page quickly, Pre-cache other pages, and Lazy-load non-essential stuff. This makes the site feel instant, even on slow connections. It often uses service workers and is common in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
