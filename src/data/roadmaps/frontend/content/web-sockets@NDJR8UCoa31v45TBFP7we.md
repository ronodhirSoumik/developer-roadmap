# Web Sockets

WebSockets enable real-time, two-way communication between a client and server over a single, persistent TCP connection. This is ideal for applications needing fast, low-latency data exchange, like online games or live data streams, as it avoids repeated HTTP requests. Most modern browsers support WebSockets, and it integrates with various programming languages and frameworks.
