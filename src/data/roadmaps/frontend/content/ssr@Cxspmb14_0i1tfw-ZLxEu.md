# Server-side rendering

Server-side rendering (SSR) means websites are built on the server before being sent to your browser as complete HTML. This is different from client-side rendering, where the browser builds the page. SSR helps pages load faster at first and is better for search engines. It's good for sites with lots of content. Frameworks like Next.js (for React) and Nuxt.js (for Vue) use SSR. It can make servers busier but improves performance, especially on slow devices.
