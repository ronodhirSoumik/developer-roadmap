# Package Managers

Package managers are tools that help install, update, and remove software pieces (packages). They manage versions and what other packages are needed. Examples are npm for JavaScript and pip for Python. They make it easy to share and reuse code by keeping packages in one place. Package managers simplify project setup and help keep things consistent. They are very important for modern software development by making work smoother and improving teamwork.
