# Web Security Knowledge

Web security involves protecting websites and applications from cyber threats through practices like HTTPS/TLS for secure data, XSS/SQL injection/CSRF prevention, CSP implementation, secure authentication/session management, input validation, clickjacking protection, secure cookie handling, and regular updates. It also means understanding OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities, access controls, secure coding, and staying informed on new threats. A good strategy combines prevention, audits, and incident response to protect web resources and data.
