# Yarn

Yarn is a JavaScript package manager developed by Facebook, offering a fast, reliable, and secure alternative to npm. It ensures consistent installations with a lockfile, speeds up processes with parallel installations and offline mode, and enhances security via checksum verification. Yarn, especially later versions like Berry with Plug'n'Play, is favored for large projects due to its performance and efficiency in dependency management.
