- The [Go roadmap](/golang) has been completely redrawn with better quality and a more language-focused approach, replacing the previous version that was too web development oriented.
- We now have [8 new YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkZYeFmDuaN38LRfCSdAkzWVtTXMJt11A) covering all our AI features to help you make the most of them.
