# What is HTTP?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the main way information is sent and received on the internet. It's like the language web browsers and servers use to talk to each other. When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server sends back the website data. Each request is separate, so the server doesn't remember past requests. HTTP has different commands (like GET for getting data, POST for sending it). HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts information. Newer versions like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are faster. Knowing HTTP is important for anyone building websites.
