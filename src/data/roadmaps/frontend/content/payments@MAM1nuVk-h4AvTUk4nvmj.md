# Payments

The Payment Request API helps websites build checkout forms. It gives a standard way for browsers to get payment and shipping info from users. It works with credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets. A webpage creates a `PaymentRequest`, shows options, and then the user confirms. The API then gives a response to finish the payment.
