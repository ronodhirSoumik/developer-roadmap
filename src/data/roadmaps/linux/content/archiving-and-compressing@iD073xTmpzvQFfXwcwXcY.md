# Archiving and Compressing

Linux archiving combines multiple files into single archives using `tar`, while compression reduces file sizes with `gzip` and `bzip2`. Use `tar cvf` to create archives, `tar xvf` to extract, and `tar cvzf` for gzip-compressed archives. These separate processes are often combined for efficient backup and distribution, with `tar.gz` and `tar.bz2` being common formats.
