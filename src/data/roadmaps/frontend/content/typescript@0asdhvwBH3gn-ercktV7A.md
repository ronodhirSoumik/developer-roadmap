# TypeScript

TypeScript, by Microsoft, is a strongly-typed language that extends JavaScript with optional static typing. It compiles to plain JavaScript, running anywhere JavaScript does. TypeScript enhances IDE support with better code completion, refactoring, and error detection. It introduces interfaces, generics, and decorators for robust software architecture, proving valuable for large apps by improving maintainability and readability. Its type system catches errors early, reducing runtime issues. TypeScript is a standard in modern web development.
