# Domain Name

A domain name is a human-friendly web address (e.g., google.com) that acts as a memorable substitute for numerical IP addresses. It comprises a second-level domain (like "google") and a top-level domain (like ".com"). Registered via domain registrars, these unique names are key for branding and online presence. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates these names into IP addresses, enabling easy website access. Domain names are vital for web structure and accessibility.
