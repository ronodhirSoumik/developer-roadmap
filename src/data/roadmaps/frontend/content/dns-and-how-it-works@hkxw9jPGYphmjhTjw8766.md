# DNS

DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses computers use. It's a global, decentralized system of servers. When you enter a domain name, DNS servers find the corresponding IP address, letting your browser connect to the website. This makes navigating the internet easy, as you don't need to remember numeric IP addresses.
