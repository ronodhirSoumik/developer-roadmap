# Creating and Deleting Files

Linux file operations include creating files with `touch` (empty files) or `cat > filename` (with content) and deleting with `rm filename`. Use `rm -i` for confirmation prompts and `rmdir` for empty directories. File deletion is permanent - no recycle bin. Essential commands for basic file management and system administration.
