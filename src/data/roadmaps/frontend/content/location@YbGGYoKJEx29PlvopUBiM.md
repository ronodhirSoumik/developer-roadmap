# Location API

The Geolocation API lets websites know a device's location (like latitude and longitude). This is for apps that use location, like maps. It uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and other sensors. The website must ask for permission first. If given, it can get the current location, watch for changes, or find distances. This helps make location-aware web apps.
