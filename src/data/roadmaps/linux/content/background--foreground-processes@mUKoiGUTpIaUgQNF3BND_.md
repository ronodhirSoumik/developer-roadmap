# Background and Foreground Processes

Linux processes run in foreground (fg) taking direct user input or background (bg) running independently. Start background processes with `command &` or use `Ctrl+Z` then `bg` to pause and resume in background. Use `fg` to bring background processes to foreground. These job control commands enable managing multiple tasks from a single terminal efficiently.
