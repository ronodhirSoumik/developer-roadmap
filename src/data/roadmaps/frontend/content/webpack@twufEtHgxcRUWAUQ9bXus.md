# Webpack

Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler that processes and packages web resources, including JavaScript, CSS, images, and fonts. It uses loaders for preprocessing and plugins for tasks like optimization. Key features are code splitting, lazy loading, hot module replacement for faster development, and tree shaking to remove unused code. Despite a steeper learning curve, Webpack's flexibility and power make it a standard for complex JavaScript applications.
