# Managing Permissions

Linux file permissions control access to files and directories using read, write, and execute rights for user, group, and others. Use `chmod` to change permissions, `chown` to change ownership, and `chgrp` to change group ownership. Proper permission management is essential for system security and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories.
