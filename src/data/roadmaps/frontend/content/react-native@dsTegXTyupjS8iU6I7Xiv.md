# React Native

React Native, by Facebook, lets you build real mobile apps for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React. It turns your code into native app parts, so apps look and feel native and run fast. You can share code between iOS and Android, saving time and money. It has features like hot reloading (see changes instantly) and access to phone features. It's great for web developers who know React and want to make mobile apps.
