# CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a browser security feature that controls how web pages access resources from different domains. It allows servers to specify who can access their assets (like APIs or fonts). CORS uses HTTP headers; browsers may send a preflight request to check if the actual request is allowed. This prevents unauthorized access while enabling legitimate cross-origin requests, vital for modern apps using multiple domain services.
