# Apollo

Apollo GraphQL is a platform for using GraphQL in apps. It has tools for both client (front-end) and server (back-end). Apollo Client helps with caching, data, and state in the front-end. Apollo Server helps build GraphQL APIs. Apollo also offers tools for managing your data graph, checking performance, and more. It simplifies GraphQL, helping build faster and more scalable apps.
