# Qwik

Qwik is a new front-end tool for making websites load super fast. It uses a "resumable" idea, meaning apps start with very little JavaScript. Qwik only loads code for interactive parts when you need them. This makes even big websites feel quick. It's getting noticed for its smart way of making sites fast.
