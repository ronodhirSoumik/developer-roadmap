We've revamped some of our older roadmaps and added new AI features to help you learn better.

- Roadmap pages now have a [floating AI Tutor](/frontend) that can help you learn anything while following the roadmap.
- There is a new [dedicated AI Tutor page](/frontend/ai) for each roadmap, where you can learn any topic of the roadmap, save history and more.
- With [global chat](/ai/chat), you can ask any question about your career, upload your resume, get guidance, tips, roadmap suggestions and more.
- Topic pages of roadmaps now have a new [AI Tutor](/frontend) that can help you learn the topic, get quizzed on the topic and more.
- Apart from courses, you can now [generate AI Guides and AI Roadmaps](/ai) for any topic.
- [MongoDB](/mongodb), [Kubernetes](/kubernetes), [Spring Boot](/spring-boot), [Linux](/linux), [React Native](/react-native) and [GraphQL](/graphql) roadmaps have been updated.
