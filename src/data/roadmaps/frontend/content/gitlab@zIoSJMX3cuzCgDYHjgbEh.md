# GitLab

GitLab is a web platform for the entire software development process (DevOps). It offers many tools in one place. You can use it online or host it yourself. GitLab is popular with businesses that want one platform for all their development work. It's like GitHub but often highlighted for its built-in CI/CD (automating build and release) and self-hosting options.
