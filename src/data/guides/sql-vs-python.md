## What are SQL and Python?

SQL is a specialized language for handling structured data in relational databases. SQL allows you to extract, modify, and delete records to generate insights that support data-driven decision-making. SQL is beginner-friendly, and you can perform database interactions and queries using understandable commands.

On the other hand, Python is a general-purpose programming language used to build web and desktop applications, perform data analysis, and automate tasks, among other uses. Python has a simple and readable syntax, making it a good language to learn when starting your programming journey.

## Key features of SQL

Some key features of SQL include:

- **Declarative language:** SQL uses a declarative programming approach where you describe what you want to achieve rather than explicitly defining how to achieve it. For example, the SQL statement `SELECT * FROM Users` means "fetch all the users from a database table." The database engine then performs its magic behind the scenes to execute the command.

- **Easy syntax:** SQL is straightforward to learn and understand, even if you have no prior programming knowledge.

- **Usage:** Almost all Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server, adopt SQL.

- **Scalability**: You can use SQL to add new tables, edit tables, and delete old tables. This means you can use it to scale up or down to accommodate datasets according to business needs.

- **Wide range of commands**: SQL supports different types of commands. These commands can be divided into the following:
    - **Data Query Language (DQL)**: The primary focus of DQL is to retrieve data without modifying it. The primary command here is `SELECT`. 
    
    - **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: You use these commands to define and modify the structure of database objects such as tables, schemas, indexes, and so on. The key commands here are `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`.
        
    - **Data Control Language (DCL)**: You use these commands to control access to data in a database by granting or revoking user permissions. Examples include `GRANT`, and  `REVOKE`.

    - **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: This is a subset of SQL you use to insert, update, and delete data from database tables. Examples include `INSERT`, `DELETE`, and `UPDATE`.

    - **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**: You use these commands to manage transactions in a database. They help ensure the data is secure and consistent. Examples include `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`.

You'll get to practice using all these command types hands-on in our [SQL course](https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql). Each lesson focuses on practical query writing and real use cases, which helps you understand when and how to apply what you learn.

## Key features of Python

Here are some of the key features of Python:

- **Easy to read and understand**: Python syntax is clean and readable. Instead of curly braces, it uses indentation for code blocks, making it easier to scan and debug.

- **Object-oriented programming language**: Python uses object-oriented programming concepts that solve problems using objects. OOP improves code reusability.

- **Free and open-source**: Being open-source, Python has a massive ecosystem and community. You'll find beginner-friendly issues, helpful tutorials, and thousands of open libraries.

- **Portability**: Python code can run on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, as well as on embedded platforms such as Raspberry Pi, STM32, and ESP32.

## How SQL and Python work together in data projects

You use SQL for data management, i.e., retrieving, filtering, organizing, and inserting data. On the other hand, you use Python for more general programming applications, such as data manipulation, statistical analysis, machine learning, and automation.

Let's walk through a practical scenario demonstrating how to use both for data analysis. Suppose you're assigned a project to analyze the sales data of an e-commerce company and develop a sales forecast. Here's how you might approach it:

1. **Data collection**: This involves gathering all relevant data from the client, which may be in different locations and formats. Your goal is to consolidate the data into a unified structure for analysis. If the data is in the client's database, you can use SQL to extract and migrate it to a destination database. If the data is accessible via an API, you can use Python to fetch it and store it in your database for further processing.

2. **Data cleaning:** Before analysis, you should make sure the data is accurate, consistent, and reliable. This step involves identifying and correcting errors, handling missing values, and resolving inconsistencies. You can use SQL basic cleaning tasks, such as:

    - Removing rows with missing data
    - Dropping unwanted columns
    - Setting default values 
    - Filtering and grouping data based on specific criteria
    - Combining data from multiple tables

    However, Python is more suitable for complex cleaning operations, such as handling nested structures, working with unstructured data, and data transformation. NumPy and Pandas are popular Python libraries that provide powerful tools and functions for advanced data cleaning and manipulation.
    
3. **Data manipulation:** Once the data is cleaned, the next step is to organize it in a way that makes it easier to analyze and interpret. Use Python to analyze and manipulate data. Python's Numpy and Pandas libraries offer robust tools for reshaping, filtering, and aggregating your cleaned data as well as restructuring data, making it ready for visualization and further analysis.

4. **Data visualization**: For basic visualizations, you can use some data analytics tools based on SQL. However, Python is more commonly used for creating detailed and customizable visualizations. Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are widely used in the data science community and support 2D and 3D plots.

5. **Making predictions**: After cleaning and exploring the data, you can use it to build predictive models. This stage is typically handled entirely in Python, as SQL is not designed for machine learning. Python offers extensive libraries, like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, which provide a wide range of regression, classification, and clustering algorithms. By training and evaluating models using these tools, you can generate accurate sales forecasts based on the data.

## Should you learn SQL or Python first?

Start with SQL if your primary goal is to work with databases, and learn Python next to expand what you can do with that data. I began my career by learning SQL first, and it turned out to be the right decision. It helped me understand how data is stored, structured, and queried, which made it much easier to learn Python later. Once I had the data in hand, Python gave me the flexibility to clean, analyze, and build models on top of it. Learning SQL first gave me a strong foundation that I still rely on today.

If you're just getting started, check out our [SQL course](https://roadmap.sh/courses/sql). The course offers interactive query writing with instant feedback, which helps solidify your understanding.

However, deciding which language to learn first depends on your goals and interests. But if you want to succeed in the data field, mastering both SQL and Python is important. They complement each other and make you a more effective data professional.

## Is SQL a dying language?

There is an [ongoing debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/svc7ju/is_sql_still_has_viable_as_it_was_several_years/) about whether SQL is becoming obsolete and if it's still worth learning. My answer is no. SQL is not dying. In fact, it remains one of the most widely used languages in data analysis and management. 

While technologies like NoSQL databases and other document and graph-based databases have gained popularity, they haven't replaced SQL. Instead, SQL has continued to evolve and adapt to modern data needs, including large-scale data processing. As long as organizations store data in relational databases, SQL will remain a valuable skill in the data professional's toolkit.

## SQL vs. Python: Key differences that trip people up
