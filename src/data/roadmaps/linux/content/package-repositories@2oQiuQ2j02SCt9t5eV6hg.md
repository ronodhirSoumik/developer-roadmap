# Package Repositories

Package repositories are storage locations containing software packages for Linux distributions. They enable easy installation, updates, and dependency management through package managers like apt, yum, or dnf. Each distribution has pre-configured repositories with tested, secure packages. Use commands like `apt update` or `yum update` to sync with repositories.
