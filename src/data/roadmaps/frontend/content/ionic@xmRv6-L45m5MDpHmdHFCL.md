# Ionic

Ionic is a tool for building mobile and desktop apps using web tech (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue. It gives you ready-made UI parts and access to phone features. Ionic wraps your web app so it can be a native app. It tries to make apps look and feel native on different platforms. Ionic is good for quickly making apps for many platforms with one codebase.
