# Progressive Web Apps

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are websites that act like native apps. They use web tech (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) but offer features like offline use, push alerts, and home screen icons. PWAs work on many devices and browsers, load fast, and can be found on search engines. They use service workers for background tasks and caching. PWAs are a cost-effective way to build cross-platform apps with a smooth user experience.
