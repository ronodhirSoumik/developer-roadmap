# Fetch API

The Fetch API is a new way for JavaScript in browsers to make HTTP requests (getting or sending data online). It's better and more flexible than older ways like XMLHttpRequest. Fetch uses Promises, making code that waits for data cleaner. It handles different data types and request methods (GET, POST). It's now the standard way for websites to talk to servers and is supported by most browsers.
