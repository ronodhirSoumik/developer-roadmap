# Browsers

Web browsers are apps that let you view websites. When you type a web address, the browser asks a server for the page. It then reads the HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript (interactivity) to show you the webpage. Browsers have rendering engines (like Blink in Chrome or Gecko in Firefox) to display content and JavaScript engines (like V8 in Chrome) to run code. They also handle things like security, bookmarks, and history.
