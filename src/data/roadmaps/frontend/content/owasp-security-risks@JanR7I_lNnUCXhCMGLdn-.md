# OWASP Security Risks

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) lists the biggest security dangers for web apps. The OWASP Top 10 includes things like injection attacks, bad authentication, data exposure, and using old, unsafe code. These are common ways hackers break into websites. OWASP gives advice on how to fix these problems by coding securely, checking for issues often, and using strong security from start to finish. Knowing these risks helps protect web apps.
