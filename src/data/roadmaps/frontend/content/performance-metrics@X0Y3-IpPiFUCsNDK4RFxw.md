# Performance Metrics

Web performance metrics measure how fast and efficient a webpage is. They help find ways to improve. Key metrics include: Load time (how long to fully load), First Contentful Paint (FCP - when first content shows), Time to Interactive (TTI - when page is usable), First Input Delay (FID - time to respond to first click/tap), and Total Blocking Time (TBT - time main thread is blocked).
