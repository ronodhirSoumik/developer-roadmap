# SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)

SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) is a super-fast tool for changing modern JavaScript and TypeScript code into older versions that more browsers can understand. It's written in Rust, making it much faster than tools like Babel. SWC can compile and bundle code, speeding up website building. It supports new JavaScript features, JSX (used with React), and TypeScript. It's popular for big JavaScript projects and is used by other tools to make them faster too.
