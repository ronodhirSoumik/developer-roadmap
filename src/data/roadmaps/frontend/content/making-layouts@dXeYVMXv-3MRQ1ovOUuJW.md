# Making layouts

Making web layouts means arranging content on a page well. Modern CSS uses Flexbox (for rows/columns) and CSS Grid (for 2D layouts). Responsive design makes sites fit all devices. Frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind help build faster. Good layouts think about what's important, how users move through the page, and if everyone can use it. This makes the site look good and work well.
