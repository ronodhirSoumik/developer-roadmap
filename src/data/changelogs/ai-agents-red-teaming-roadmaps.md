We added new AI roadmaps for AI Agents and Red Teaming and made our AI Tutor better with courses created by the community.

- We just released a new [AI Agents Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/ai-agents) that covers how to build, design, and run smart autonomous systems.
- There's also a new [Red Teaming Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/ai-red-teaming) for people who want to learn about testing AI systems for weaknesses and security flaws.
- Our [AI Tutor](https://roadmap.sh/ai) now lets you use courses made by other users. You can learn from their content or share your own learning plans.
