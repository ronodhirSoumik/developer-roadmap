# Prettier

Prettier is a tool that automatically formats your code to look consistent. It works with many languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS. Prettier takes your code and rewrites it following its own style rules, like line length. This stops arguments about code style and saves time. It can be used in code editors or run automatically before you commit code. Prettier is popular because it's easy to use and keeps code looking the same for everyone.
