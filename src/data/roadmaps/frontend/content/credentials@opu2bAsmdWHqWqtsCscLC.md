# Credentials API

The Credential Management API helps websites work with the browser's password manager. It lets sites store and get user logins securely, making sign-in and sign-up easier (like auto sign-in). It supports passwords and other login types. This API improves login experience and security by working with password managers and platform authenticators, making logins smoother across devices.
