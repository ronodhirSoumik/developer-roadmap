# Installing, Removing, and Upgrading Packages

Package management in Linux involves installing, removing, and upgrading software using distribution-specific tools. Use `apt` for Debian/Ubuntu, `yum`/`dnf` for Fedora/RHEL/CentOS, and `zypper` for SUSE. Common operations include `install package-name`, `remove package-name`, and `upgrade` commands. Each package manager has specific syntax but similar functionality for software lifecycle management.
