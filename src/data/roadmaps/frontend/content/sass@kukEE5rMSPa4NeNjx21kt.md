# Sass

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a tool that makes writing CSS easier and more powerful. It adds features like variables (to store colors or sizes), nested rules (to organize your styles better), and mixins (to reuse styles). This helps keep your CSS neat and easy to manage, especially in big projects. Sass code gets turned into regular CSS that browsers can understand. It has two ways of writing: the original indented style and the more common SCSS style. Sass is popular because it saves time and makes CSS less repetitive.
