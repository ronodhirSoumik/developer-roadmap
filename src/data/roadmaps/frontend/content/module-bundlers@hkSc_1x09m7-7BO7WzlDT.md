# Module Bundlers

Module bundlers are tools that take many JavaScript files and combine them into one, which is better for web browsers. They handle dependencies, improve code, and can split code for faster loading. Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel are examples. They help manage big JavaScript projects by organizing code into modules and making load times better. Bundlers also let you use new JavaScript features by changing them to older versions if needed. They make development smoother and apps run better.
