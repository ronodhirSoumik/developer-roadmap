# Starting and Stopping Services

Linux service management involves controlling system services like databases, web servers, and network services. Use `systemctl start service_name` to start services, `systemctl stop service_name` to stop them, and `systemctl restart service_name` to restart. These commands require root permissions via sudo and are essential for system administration and configuration management.
