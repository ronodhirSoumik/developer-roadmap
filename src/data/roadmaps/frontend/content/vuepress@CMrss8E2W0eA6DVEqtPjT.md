# Vuepress

VuePress is a Vue.js-powered static site generator ideal for documentation. It creates pre-rendered static HTML for fast, SEO-friendly sites, featuring a Vue-based theming system, code syntax highlighting, and a default theme for technical docs. It supports Markdown with Vue components for dynamic content, built-in search, responsive layouts, and customization via plugins/themes. While great for docs, it also suits blogs and simple websites, valued for its simplicity, performance, and Vue.js integration.
