# Astro

Astro is a static site generator for fast, content-focused websites. It lets you use various frontend frameworks (like React, Vue, Svelte) and renders components to static HTML. Astro's "partial hydration" only sends JavaScript when needed, leading to smaller bundles and quicker loads. It supports file-based routing and markdown, making it great for blogs, docs, and marketing sites.
