# CSS Preprocessors

CSS preprocessors (like Sass, Less, Stylus) add extra features to CSS, making it easier to write and manage. They offer things like variables (for colors, sizes), nesting (to organize styles), mixins (reusable style blocks), and functions. This helps keep CSS tidy and avoid repetition, especially in big projects. The preprocessor code is then turned into regular CSS that browsers understand. They make CSS more powerful and efficient.
