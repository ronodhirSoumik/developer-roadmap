# Content Security Policy

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature in web browsers that helps stop attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. It lets website creators tell the browser which sources of content (like scripts, styles, and images) are safe to load. This is done using special instructions sent with the webpage. By limiting where content can come from, CSP makes it much harder for bad code to run on a site. It can also report problems, helping developers find and fix security holes. Setting up CSP needs care to make sure everything works right, especially if the site uses content from other places.
