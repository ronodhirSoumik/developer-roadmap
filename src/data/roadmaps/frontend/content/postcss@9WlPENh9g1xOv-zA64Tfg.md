# PostCSS

PostCSS is a tool that uses JavaScript plugins to change CSS. It can automate tasks, add browser prefixes (like `-webkit-`), and let you use future CSS features now. It's like a CSS preprocessor but more flexible, as you pick the plugins you need. Popular plugins include Autoprefixer, cssnext, and cssnano (for making CSS smaller). PostCSS works with many build tools and is liked for its flexibility and speed in modern web development.
