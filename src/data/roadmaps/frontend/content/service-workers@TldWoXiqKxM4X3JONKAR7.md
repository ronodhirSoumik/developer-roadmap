# Service Workers

Service Workers are special JavaScript files that act like a middleman between a webpage and the internet. They help build apps that work offline. Service Workers can catch network requests, use stored (cached) data, and decide how to respond, even if the webpage isn't open. This allows for features like push notifications, background updates, and offline use. Most modern browsers support them, and they are key for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
