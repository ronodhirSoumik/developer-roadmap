# Testing your apps

Testing apps means checking if software works right and meets goals. Types include unit (small parts), integration (how parts work together), functional (if it does what it should), UI/UX (look and feel), performance (speed), security, accessibility (for disabilities), and compatibility (on different devices). Modern testing uses automated tools and CI/CD (automating build and release). TDD and BDD are ways to write tests with code. Good testing finds bugs early and makes apps better.
