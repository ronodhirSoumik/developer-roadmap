# Device Orientation API

The Device Orientation API lets websites know how a device is tilted or moving (like its pitch, roll, and yaw). This is for apps that react to movement, like augmented reality or motion games. The site must ask for permission first. If allowed, it can get the device's orientation and react to changes. It helps make interactive, motion-aware web apps.
