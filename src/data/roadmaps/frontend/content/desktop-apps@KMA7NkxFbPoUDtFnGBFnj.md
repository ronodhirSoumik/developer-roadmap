# Desktop Applications in JavaScript

JavaScript can build desktop apps using tools like Electron, NW.js, or Tauri. These mix JavaScript with a native look and feel, letting web developers make desktop apps for different systems (like Windows, Mac, Linux). Electron is very popular (used by VS Code, Discord). These tools let JavaScript access computer features like files. While they make development fast and work on many systems, they can sometimes be slower or use more resources than fully native apps. But, they benefit from all the JavaScript tools available.
