# Disks and Filesystems

Linux supports various filesystems like EXT4, FAT32, NTFS, and Btrfs for organizing data on storage devices. Each filesystem has specific advantages - EXT4 for Linux systems, FAT32 for compatibility across operating systems. The `df -T` command displays mounted filesystems with their types, sizes, and available space information.
