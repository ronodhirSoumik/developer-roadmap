# Vitest

Vitest is a speedy testing tool for JavaScript and TypeScript, made to work well with Vite (a build tool). It runs tests very quickly and updates them live as you code. Vitest is similar to Jest (another testing tool), so it's easy to switch if you're used to Jest. It includes features like snapshot testing, mocking, and checking code coverage. Vitest can run multiple tests at once and watch for changes, making testing faster. It's great for Vite projects but works with any JavaScript project too.
