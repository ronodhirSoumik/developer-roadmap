# Uptime and Load

The `uptime` command shows how long a Linux system has been running and the system load average. Load average indicates computational work and CPU queue length, displayed for 1, 5, and 15-minute intervals. High load averages suggest resource constraints or performance issues. Regular monitoring helps identify usage patterns and plan capacity.
