# react-router

React Router is a key tool for React apps that need different pages or views. It handles the website's URL, letting you create single-page apps that feel like they have multiple pages. It provides components to define routes (paths to different views) and link between them. Features include lazy loading (loading parts only when needed) and route guards (controlling access to pages). It's the standard for navigation in React apps.
