# Web Storage API

The Web Storage API lets websites store information directly in your web browser. It has two main types: `localStorage` (keeps data even after you close the browser) and `sessionStorage` (keeps data only while the browser tab is open). This is useful for saving things like user preferences or items in a shopping cart. It's simpler and can hold more data than traditional cookies, and most modern browsers support it.
