# Static Site Generators

Static Site Generators (SSGs) are tools that build websites as simple HTML files. They take your content (like Markdown files) and templates, and create all the pages beforehand. This makes websites fast, secure, and easy to host. Examples are Jekyll, Hugo, and Eleventy. They are great for blogs and documentation. SSGs offer good performance and are simple to manage.
