# npm

npm (Node Package Manager) is the main tool for managing code packages in Node.js. It helps developers find, share, and use JavaScript code easily. Think of it as a big library where you can get tools and code bits for your projects. npm uses a file called `package.json` to keep track of what your project needs, making it easy to build your project anywhere. Even with other tools like Yarn, npm is still the most popular choice for JavaScript developers.
