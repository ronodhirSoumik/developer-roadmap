# Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML uses markup to convey the meaning of web content, not just its appearance, by employing elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. This practice enhances accessibility, SEO, and code readability. It includes proper use of headings, lists, and tables. Semantic HTML aids screen readers, improves browser rendering, and offers clearer structure for developers, leading to more meaningful, accessible, and maintainable web documents for both humans and machines.
